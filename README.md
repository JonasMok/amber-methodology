# Search for illegal amber mining HOWTO

This is a description of methodology for this project: http://texty.org.ua/d/2018/amber_eng
Main idea for the project - use machine learning to find all places of illegal amber mining in Nothern-West regions of Ukraine.


## Motivation

In 2010 world prices for amber started to surge. Due to this in 2012 demand was so high that north-western part of Ukraine became place of "amber rush" and "new Wild West". Thousands of prospectors starts to search for gems with shovels and later with water pumps. Hundreds of areas in forests / agricultural land became a desert, a lifeless moon landscape.

We decided to estimate, for the first time, an environmental impact of this phenomenon. 


## Main steps 

1. Research how patches of land with illegal mining could look on satellite images
2. Find which map providers could some examples of places with mining on images 
3. Create training set
2. Use neural net to extract features in satellite photography.
   


We present most informative, as for this moment, interactive map of impact on environment due to illegal amber mining in Ukraine.
